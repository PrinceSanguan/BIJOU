        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-center">Sheffield landlords lose thousands annually due to rent arrears and late payments. The National Residential Landlords Association reports that 47% of UK landlords experienced rent arrears in 2024, with average collection delays costing <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>£2,100 per property yearly</span>.</p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-center">Managing rent collection manually creates endless stress: chasing tenants via phone calls, tracking multiple payment dates, handling excuses, and maintaining complex spreadsheets. HMO landlords face even greater challenges with multiple tenants per property, increasing arrears risk exponentially.</p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-center">Our professional rent management service eliminates these headaches completely. We handle everything from automated collection to legal compliance, ensuring your rental income flows reliably whilst you focus on growing your property portfolio. With Sheffield's rental market tightening and the Renters Reform Bill introducing stricter landlord obligations, professional rent management isn't luxury—it's <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>essential protection</span> for your investment.</p>

        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Step 1: Automated Direct Debit Setup</h3>
        <p>We establish secure direct debit mandates with all tenants on move-in day. Rent automatically transfers on agreed dates, eliminating forgotten payments and manual collection efforts.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Step 2: Proactive Payment Monitoring</h3>
        <p>Our system tracks all rent payments in real-time. If payments are missed or delayed, automated reminders are sent within 24 hours, followed by personalised tenant contact.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Step 3: Professional Arrears Management</h3>
        <p>Late payments trigger our structured arrears protocol: immediate tenant communication, realistic repayment plans, and escalation procedures that comply with current tenancy legislation and tenant rights.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Step 4: Comprehensive Financial Reporting</h3>
        <p>Monthly statements provide complete transparency: rent received, outstanding amounts, tenant payment history, and annual summaries for tax purposes. Everything accessible through our secure landlord portal.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Step 5: Legal Compliance & Documentation</h3>
        <p>When required, we prepare Section 8 notices, possession proceedings documentation, and liaison with legal professionals—always respecting tenant rights and following proper procedures.</p>
