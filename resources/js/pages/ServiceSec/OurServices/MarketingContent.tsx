        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#0E5248] text-center mb-6">The Sheffield Rental Marketing Challenge</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Sheffield's competitive rental market sees over 2,000 new property listings monthly, yet 40% of rooms and units remain vacant for more than 6 weeks. Poor quality photos, generic descriptions, and wrong platform targeting cost landlords thousands in lost rental income.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Local HMO properties in areas like Broomhill and Crookes struggle particularly, with outdated marketing approaches failing to attract quality tenants. Student accommodation around the University of Sheffield faces fierce competition, while professional lets in Ecclesall require sophisticated marketing for rooms & units to command premium rents.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Research shows that properties with professional marketing fill 3x faster than DIY listings, yet many Sheffield landlords still rely on basic phone photos and template descriptions that fail to showcase their property's unique appeal.</p>
