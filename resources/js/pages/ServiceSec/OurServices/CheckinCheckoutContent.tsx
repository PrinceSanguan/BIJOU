        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#0E5248] text-center mb-6">The Sheffield Tenant Transition Challenge</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Tenant disputes cost Sheffield landlords over £2.3M annually, with 78% of conflicts arising from inadequate check-in and check-out procedures. Poor documentation at tenancy start leads to costly deposit disputes, while rushed move-out processes result in unrecovered damages and cleaning costs.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Properties in high-turnover areas like Broomhill student accommodation and Crookes HMOs face particular challenges, with frequent tenancy changes requiring systematic documentation. Professional lets in Ecclesall and city center locations demand thorough accountability measures to maintain property standards and protect rental investments.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Research indicates that properties with professional check-ins and check-outs experience 85% fewer deposit disputes and recover 40% more costs from departing tenants through proper documentation and accountability procedures.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Our systematic approach covers all property types from student HMOs in Broomhill to executive apartments in city center locations. We understand Sheffield's diverse rental market requirements and tailor our documentation procedures accordingly.</p>
