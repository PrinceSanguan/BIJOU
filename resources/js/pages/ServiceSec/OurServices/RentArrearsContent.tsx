        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Sheffield landlords lose thousands annually due to rent arrears and late payments. The National Residential Landlords Association reports that 47% of UK landlords experienced rent arrears in 2024, with average collection delays costing <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>£2,100 per property yearly</span>.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Managing rent collection manually creates endless stress: chasing tenants via phone calls, tracking multiple payment dates, handling excuses, and maintaining complex spreadsheets. HMO landlords face even greater challenges with multiple tenants per property, increasing arrears risk exponentially.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Our professional rent management service eliminates these headaches completely. We handle everything from automated collection to legal compliance, ensuring your rental income flows reliably whilst you focus on growing your property portfolio. With Sheffield's rental market tightening and the Renters Reform Bill introducing stricter landlord obligations, professional rent management isn't luxury—it's <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>essential protection</span> for your investment.</p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Every Sheffield Landlord's Worst Nightmare</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">You know the feeling. Rent was due yesterday. Your tenant's making excuses. Your mortgage payment is next week.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">We see it all the time - good tenants hit hard times, unreliable ones take advantage, and landlords end up thousands out of pocket whilst still paying all the bills. One Sheffield landlord we helped last month was <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>£4,800 behind</span> across two properties. Couldn't sleep, couldn't concentrate at work, considering selling up.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That's not property investment - that's <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>punishment</span>.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The worst part? Most landlords wait too long to take action. They hope things will sort themselves out. They don't want confrontation. Meanwhile, the debt grows bigger and harder to recover every single week.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-4 text-lg">
          <li>Tenants stop answering calls and avoid face-to-face conversations</li>
          <li>Informal "I'll pay you back" promises get broken repeatedly</li>
          <li>No proper paperwork means you can't prove what's owed in court</li>
          <li>Expensive solicitors charge thousands whether you recover anything or not</li>
          <li>Court processes drag on for months whilst arrears keep mounting</li>
          <li>Properties sit empty after messy evictions that could've been avoided</li>

        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Look, we're not miracle workers. But we are experienced debt collectors who understand Sheffield's rental market inside out. We've been doing this for fifteen years. We know which approaches work with different types of tenants, how to document everything properly for court, and - crucially - how to recover money without creating enemies who'll trash your property on the way out.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Our approach is simple: Professional, firm, but fair. We've found that most tenants will engage properly when contacted by a third party who knows what they're doing. Many rental arrears get resolved without involving lawyers or bailiffs - saving everyone time, money, and stress.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">When court action is necessary, we've already built the case properly from day one. No scrambling for evidence, no weak documentation that gets thrown out by magistrates.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-4 text-lg">
          <li>We recover money in <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>78%</span> of cases we take on</li>
