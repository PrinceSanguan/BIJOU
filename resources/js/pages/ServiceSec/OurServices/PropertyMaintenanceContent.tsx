    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Don't Let Property Problems Become Expensive Disasters</h2>
    <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-center">Property maintenance issues escalate quickly without professional attention.

A simple leak can cause structural damage costing thousands, whilst electrical faults create serious safety risks.</p>

We maintain your property's condition, ensure legal compliance, and keep tenants satisfied through professional, reliable service that protects your investment long-term.</p>
