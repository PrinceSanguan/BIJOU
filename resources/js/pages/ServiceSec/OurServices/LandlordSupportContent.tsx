        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#0E5248] text-center mb-6">The Sheffield Landlord Support Challenge</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Sheffield's complex rental market leaves 65% of landlords feeling overwhelmed by regulatory changes, tenant issues, and portfolio management decisions. New landlords struggle with fundamental letting processes, while experienced investors face scaling challenges and compliance complexities across diverse property types.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Local market dynamics in areas like Broomhill student lets, Crookes HMO investments, and Ecclesall professional rentals each require specialized knowledge. With over 40,000 rental properties across Sheffield, landlords need reliable expertise to navigate everything from tenant disputes to legislative changes affecting their investments.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Research shows that landlords without professional support experience 50% more void periods, 70% more tenant disputes, and miss growth opportunities worth an average of £12,000 annually due to inadequate guidance and reactive management approaches.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">We maintain direct relationships with Sheffield solicitors, accountants, contractors, and regulatory bodies, ensuring our dedicated landlord support and advice connects you with trusted local professionals when specialized services are required.</p>
