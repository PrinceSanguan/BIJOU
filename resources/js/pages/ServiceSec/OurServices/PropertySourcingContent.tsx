        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#0E5248] text-center mb-6">The Sheffield Property Investment Challenge</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Sheffield's property investment market offers tremendous opportunities, yet 70% of investors struggle to identify profitable deals that align with their specific goals. Rising property prices, hidden maintenance issues, and complex market dynamics make property sourcing increasingly challenging for time-pressed investors.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Local investment hotspots like Kelham Island and Broomhill see intense competition, with quality properties selling within days of listing. Student accommodation near the University of Sheffield requires specialist knowledge, while HMO investments in areas like Crookes demand expertise in licensing and compliance requirements.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Research indicates that successful property investors spend 40+ hours weekly on property research, viewings, and due diligence. Meanwhile, 60% of DIY investors make costly mistakes due to inadequate market knowledge and rushed decision-making processes.</p>
