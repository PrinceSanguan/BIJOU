        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-center">Managing property compliance is complex and time-consuming. Gas Safety certificates expire annually, EICR electrical checks are required every five years, EPC renewals last ten years, plus HMO licensing, fire safety requirements, and Legionella assessments all demand attention.</p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-center">Missing deadlines results in council fines, potential prosecution, and safety risks. Sheffield City Council issued over <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>200 compliance penalties</span> in 2024, with fines ranging from <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>£1,000 to £30,000</span> for serious breaches.</p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-center">Our comprehensive compliance management service eliminates these risks. We handle every certificate, renewal, and legal requirement so your properties remain safe, legal, and profitable whilst you focus on growing your portfolio.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Local Expertise You Can Trust</h3>
        <p>Eight years managing Sheffield properties means we understand council requirements thoroughly. We know which areas face regular inspections and stay current with regulatory changes affecting local landlords.</p>
        <p>Our process begins with a complete audit of your existing certificates, identifying gaps and creating personalised compliance schedules. Everything is tracked digitally with automated reminders months before expiry dates.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Professional Network & Coordination</h3>
        <p>We work with vetted Gas Safe engineers, NICEIC electricians, and certified assessors who understand Sheffield properties. All contractors are qualified, insured, and provide reliable service without the usual coordination headaches.</p>
        <p>When we schedule inspections, they happen on time. Our contractors work around tenant schedules and provide professional service that maintains positive landlord-tenant relationships.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Secure Documentation & Peace of Mind</h3>
        <p>All certificates are stored digitally and accessible 24/7 through your landlord portal. No more searching for paperwork or missing documents during inspections.</p>
        <p>You receive three-month advance reminders with automatic renewal scheduling. This prevents last-minute emergencies and ensures continuous compliance across your entire portfolio.</p>
