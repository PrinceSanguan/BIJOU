    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">If You're a Sheffield Landlord, You Know The Drill...</h2>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mt-4 text-lg">
      <li>Your tenant stops paying rent. The boiler breaks down on a Sunday night. Sheffield Council wants another bloody certificate. The property sits empty for two months because you can't find decent tenants.</li>
      <li>Managing HMO and Buy-to-Let properties in Sheffield shouldn't feel like a second job. Between complex HMO licensing requirements, competitive university rental markets, and Yorkshire's ever-changing property regulations - it's exhausting.</li>
      <li>That's exactly why we started this business. We eliminate the operational headaches so you can focus on what matters: growing your property portfolio and enjoying the returns.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Why Sheffield Landlords Choose Us</h2>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">We Actually Know Sheffield Inside Out</h3>
    <p className="mt-2">We're not some national chain with a call center in Birmingham. We've been managing properties around Ecclesall Road since before it was trendy. We know which streets flood, which letting agents to avoid, and where students actually want to live.</p>
    <p>Been to every Sheffield Council meeting about HMO licensing changes. We know the inspectors by name. When new regulations drop, we're already implementing them for our clients. Local expertise you can't get elsewhere.</p>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">No More Compliance Nightmares</h3>
    <p>HMO licensing in Sheffield? We'll sort it. Gas safety certificates? Done. Fire risk assessments? Handled. Electrical inspections? Already scheduled.</p>
    <p>You won't get nasty letters from Sheffield Council because we stay on top of everything. Our clients sleep well knowing their properties are fully compliant and protected from hefty fines. Zero compliance failures in over 10 years.</p>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Proper Local Maintenance Network</h3>
    <p>Sheffield tradesmen who actually turn up when they say they will. No more cowboys, no more waiting three weeks for a simple repair.</p>
    <p>Emergency call at midnight? Our trusted contractors are on it within hours. Routine maintenance? We schedule it before things break, protecting your property value and keeping tenants happy. Same-day response for emergencies, guaranteed.</p>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">We Fill Empty Properties Fast</h3>
    <p>Empty properties cost you Â£100+ every single day. We typically get quality tenants placed within two weeks because we know exactly where to market and who to target.</p>
    <p>Student lets near University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam? We've got waiting lists. Professional couples in Kelham Island? We know precisely what they're looking for and how much they'll pay. Average void period: just 14 days.</p>
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">How We Transform Your Property Investment Experience</h2>
    <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 mt-4 text-lg">
      <li><strong>Free Property Consultation (No Obligation):</strong> We'll visit your property, walk through every room, spot potential issues, and give you brutally honest advice about rental potential. No hard sell, just straight talking about what works and what doesn't in today's Sheffield rental market.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional Tenant Sourcing & Screening:</strong> Not just anyone with a pulse gets your keys. We verify income, check employment, contact previous landlords, and run comprehensive background checks. Takes about two weeks for most properties, but you get quality tenants who actually pay rent and look after your investment.</li>
      <li><strong>Complete Hands-Off Management:</strong> Once tenants move in, we handle everything: rent collection, maintenance coordination, compliance monitoring, inspections, and tenant relations. You receive detailed monthly statements and only hear from us with good news.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem Resolution (So You Don't Have To):</strong> Tenant disputes? We mediate. Emergency repairs? We coordinate. Council inspections? We're there. Legal issues? We've got trusted Sheffield solicitors on speed dial. You stay out of the drama completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Our Sheffield Specializations</h2>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">HMO Property Management Excellence</h3>
    <p>Managing a house full of students or young professionals requires special skills. Different personalities, shared kitchens, individual tenancy agreements, room-by-room lettings - it's genuinely complicated.</p>
    <p>We've mastered the art over 10+ years. We know how to maintain peace between housemates, enforce cleaning rotas, handle the inevitable relationship dramas, and keep everyone paying rent on time.</p>
    <p>Sheffield university properties are our specialty - we understand academic calendars, group bookings, and yes, how to handle end-of-tenancy cleaning (there's always mess).</p>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">Buy-to-Let Property Management</h3>
    <p>From Victorian terraces in Crookes to modern city center apartments, we manage diverse BTL properties across Sheffield. Each area has unique characteristics, tenant expectations, and pricing strategies.</p>
    <p>We position your property competitively, target the right demographic, and maintain high standards that attract quality long-term tenants who treat your investment with respect.</p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Your Questions Answered</h2>
    <div className="mt-6">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">What are your management fees?</h3>
      <p>Between 8-12% of rental income depending on property type and services required. Most clients actually increase their net profit because we reduce void periods dramatically and solve problems before they become expensive disasters.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">How quickly do you fill vacant properties?</h3>
      <p>Usually 2-3 weeks for standard BTL properties. Individual HMO rooms often go within 7-14 days because we maintain strong relationships with local employers, universities, and have extensive tenant waiting lists.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Do you specialize in student accommodation?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. We've worked with Sheffield students for over a decade. We understand academic calendars, group dynamics, deposit protection schemes, and how to handle the unique challenges of student lettings professionally.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">What makes you different from other Sheffield letting agents?</h3>
      <p>Three things: We're genuinely local (not a national chain), we're brutally honest about what works, and we specialize exclusively in HMO and BTL management. No sales, no property sourcing distractions - just expert management.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Can you help remote landlords effectively?</h3>
      <p>Half our clients live outside Sheffield. We provide comprehensive monthly reporting, handle all local interactions, and only contact you when absolutely necessary. Perfect for busy professionals or distant investors.</p>
