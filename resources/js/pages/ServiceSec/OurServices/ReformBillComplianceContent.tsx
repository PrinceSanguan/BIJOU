        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#0E5248] text-center mb-6">The Renters (Reform) Bill Challenge for Sheffield Landlords</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">The Renters (Reform) Bill introduces the most significant changes to UK rental law in decades, yet 85% of landlords remain unclear about implementation requirements. With Section 21 abolition, new grounds for possession, and enhanced tenant protections, non-compliance risks substantial fines and legal complications.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Sheffield's 40,000+ rental properties face particular challenges with the new legislation. HMO landlords in areas like Broomhill and Crookes must navigate complex licensing changes, while traditional buy-to-let investors across Ecclesall and city center locations need updated tenancy management strategies.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Research shows that landlords who fail to implement proper Renters (Reform) Bill compliance advice face potential fines up to £30,000 per violation, plus costly legal disputes and property tribunal cases that could devastate rental business profitability.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">We maintain direct relationships with Sheffield City Council, local housing authorities, and legal professionals, ensuring our Renters (Reform) Bill compliance advice reflects current best practices and regulatory expectations.</p>
