        </h2>
        <div className="mt-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">How quickly can you find tenants for my Sheffield property?</h3>
          <p>Most well-presented properties attract quality enquiries within 24-48 hours. Our proven screening process typically secures fully referenced tenants within 7-14 days, depending on property type, location, and rental price point.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">What are your tenant finding fees and service costs?</h3>
          <p>Our tenant find fee ranges from <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>£200-400</span> depending on property value and complexity. This includes all marketing, viewings, referencing, and tenancy setup—no hidden extras. Contact us for your specific property quote.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Do you specialise in student lettings and HMO properties?</h3>
          <p>Yes, we're HMO specialists covering both student and professional shared accommodation. We understand Sheffield's licensing requirements, arrange group viewings efficiently, and find compatible housemates for existing shared properties.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">How thorough is your tenant referencing process?</h3>
          <p>Every applicant undergoes comprehensive checks: credit history, employment verification, bank statements, previous landlord references, and affordability calculations. We contact employers and previous landlords directly, not just automated reference systems.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">What happens if tenants fail your referencing checks?</h3>
          <p>Our comprehensive marketing typically generates multiple qualified applications. If initial applicants fail referencing, we immediately progress alternatives from our enquiry pipeline, minimising delays and <span className='text-[#EFBF04] font-semibold'>void periods</span>.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Do you cover all areas of Sheffield for tenant finding?</h3>
          <p>We cover all Sheffield areas including popular rental locations: Broomhill, Crookes, Ecclesall, City Centre, Sharrow, Hillsborough, Walkley, and Kelham Island. Each area requires different marketing strategies which we've perfected.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Can you help with Right to Rent and legal compliance?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. We handle all legal requirements including Right to Rent verification, deposit protection registration, gas safety compliance, and HMO licensing documentation. Full legal compliance is included in our service.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">What ongoing support do you provide after tenant placement?</h3>
          <p>Once tenants move in, you can transition to our full management service or handle the tenancy independently. We provide 3 months' free support for any tenancy-related queries following successful placement.</p>
